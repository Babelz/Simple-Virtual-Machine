# Simple-Virtual-Machine
SVM is a simple 64-bit virtual machine.
Project is being developed with C# and is not intented to be 
used with serious development. 

This project is intented to be used as a learning project only.

After SVM project, a "real" virtual machine project will be created using C/C++, with
portability, performance, security and interoperability kept in mind.

## Goals of this project
  - Get better idea how virtual machines work in general
  - Bytecode interpretation
  - Learn basics of x86-asm and improve understanding how things work on the lower levels  
  - Get familiar with assemblers and write one for the SVM
  - Get comfy with bit manipulation
  - Do some optimizations
  - Run programs of moderate complexity with the machine
  - C# interoperability

In the future, i might write a small compiler to compile programs into SVM-bytecode.
