Started memory layout reconstruction. Registers are no longer fields inside the machine,
but instead live in the same memory space as the stack. Now the memory layout will 
be constructed as follows:
	   
	  62-bytes     n-bytes
[0.. register space ..67][68.. stack ..]

Register space will take total of 496 bits (62 bytes total). This should simplify our logic and boost our performance
when dealing with register operations.

Started to refactor and optimize the code base.

23:01

Done with optimizing. Optimized addition speed and gained around 25x times better performance. Byte and int
conversions need the same facelift as well.

All byte helper functions have been reimplemented. Performance increases vary from function, but 
on average the gains are huge. Addition gained 25x more speed at second implementation, and when comparing
the third one to the first one, gains are around 50-70x.

Naming conventions inside the opcodes

size/...Size			- bytes count
register/...Register	- register low address
registerCapacity		- register size in bytes
bytes/...Bytes			- some byte values
cache/...Cache		    - temp array of bytes

Optimized memory usage and removed alot of allocations to the .net stack. Created new caching system
that allows easy reuse of byte arrays.
