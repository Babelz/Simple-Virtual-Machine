Started memory layout reconstruction. Registers are no longer fields inside the machine,
but insted live in the same memory space as the virtual machine. Now the memory layout will 
be constructed as follows:
	   
	  60-bytes     n-bytes
[ register space ][ stack ]

Register space will take total of 480 bits (60 bytes total). This should simplify our logic and boost our performance
when dealing with register operations.

Started to refactor and optimize the code base.

Done with optimizing. Optimized addition speed and gained around 25x times better performance. Byte and int
convertions need the same facelift aswel.

All byte helper functions have been reimplemented. Performance boost vary from function to function, but 
on average the gains are huge. Addition gained 25x more speed at second implementation, and when comparing
the third one to the first one, gains are around 50-70x
